# Design-and-implementation-of-intelligent-manhole-cover-monitoring-system-based-on-narrow-band(NB-IOT)
We did a project to detect manhole cover openings, temperature, and the presence of methane in the drainage. It also alerts the corporation whenever the drainage is open, full, or blocked by sending a message with the respective location of drainage.
